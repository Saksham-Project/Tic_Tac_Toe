🎮 Tic Tac Toe — Python Console Game

Ladies and gentlemen,
Here I present to you a basic Tic Tac Toe game built with Python.
Hope you enjoy it!

📌 What is it?

This is a classic Tic Tac Toe game played via the command line. Two players take turns to place their symbol (X or O) on a 3×3 board. The first to align three of their symbols—vertically, horizontally, or diagonally—wins the match!


🧩 Features

- Interactive console gameplay for 2 players
- Validates user input to prevent overwriting moves
- Detects win or draw conditions and terminates the game gracefully
- Simple code structure with readable functions:
- show_board() for displaying the board
- update_board() for player moves
- winning_moves() and win_decide() for result detection
- play() for managing turns and inputs


🏁 How to Play
- Run the Python file:
python tic_tac_toe.py

- You'll see a numbered board layout:
 1 | 2 | 3
---|---|---
 4 | 5 | 6
---|---|---
 7 | 8 | 9

- Players take turns entering a number (1–9) to place their symbol.
- If a move is invalid or the space is already occupied, the game asks for another input.
- Game ends when either player wins or the board is full.
